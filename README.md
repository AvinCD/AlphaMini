* **Use WIFI to connect the robot to the internet.**  (Note that the alpha mini will not able to connect with the campus WIFI, **_while programming from computer_**. Thus, we recommand to use a different WIFI or hotspot to connect the Alpha mini).

* **After successfully binding, the Alpha Mini is now able to perform tasks**.  


# Connecting AlphaMini to Computer.

We recommend to use our repositor for quick start, easy understanding of the code structure in creating custome code for the alphamini by yourself.

Apart from this repositor, there have some other resource, which are officially publised from Alphamini.
* [Alphamini Documentation](https://docs.ubtrobot.com/alphamini/python-sdk-en/)  
* [Alphamini Github](https://github.com/marklogg/mini_demo).
